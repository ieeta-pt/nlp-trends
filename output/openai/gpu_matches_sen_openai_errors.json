No explicit information is provided about the duration or number of training steps, but we can calculate an estimation based on the information given.\n\nGiven that the batch size is 256 and the accumulation steps are 8, the effective batch size per GPU is 256 / 8 = 32.\n\nTo estimate the training time, we need to consider the learning rate warm-up. The warm-up proportion is stated as 0.06, which means the learning rate is linearly increased for the first 6% of the total training steps.\n\nWithout knowing the exact duration, we can assume a typical proportion of the warm-up period is around 10-15% of the total training time. Let's assume it's 10% for this estimation.\n\nSince the warm-up period is linear, we can assume that the effective batch size per GPU is also linearly increasing during that period. After the warm-up period, the effective batch size per GPU remains constant.\n\nNow, let's calculate the estimation based on these assumptions:\n\n1. Total steps after the warm-up period:\n   - Assuming total number of steps is X\n   - Warm-up steps (10% of X) = 0.06 * X\n   - Remaining steps = X - 0.06 * X = 0.94 * X\n\n2. Effective batch size per GPU:\n   - During the warm-up period, the effective batch size linearly increases from 32 to its maximum value.\n   - After the warm-up period, the effective batch size per GPU remains constant at the maximum value.\n   - Let's assume the maximum effective batch size per GPU is Y.\n\n3. Estimating the training time:\n   - Assuming the time required to process one batch with the effective batch size Y is Z minutes.\n   - During the warm-up period, the effective batch size increases linearly, so the average effective batch size is (32 + Y) / 2.\n   - Let's approximate the average effective batch size as (32 + Y) / 2 = M.\n   - Total training time = (0.06 * X * M + 0.94 * X * Y) * Z minutes.\n\nPlease note that these are estimations based on assumptions, and the actual training time might differ based on various factors like model complexity, convergence criteria, hardware performance, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, without knowing the exact values of X, Y, M, and Z, we cannot provide a specific numeric answer for the total training time.\n\nIn any case, I'll return a JSON with the given assumptions and placeholders for the values:\n\n{\n  \"total_time\": -1,\n  \"unit\": \"MINUTE/HOURS/DAYS\",\n  \"gpus\": [\n    {\n      \"gpu\": \"GPU_NAME\",\n      \"number_of_gpus\": NUMBER\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 242, "completion_tokens": 636, "total_tokens": 878}}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7k0SPmc1vwaCIiJijBlxeH1YuuEqz", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1691199201, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the given context, the total training time of the models is not provided."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 237, "completion_tokens": 17, "total_tokens": 254}}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7k0TuPdYZ8jLM2LltGR5bZI5vtEzp", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1691199294, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The total training time for the models can be calculated based on the provided information. \n\nFrom the given CONTEXT, it is stated that the training for the main model (bert bi-encoder) is done on an Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU with 12 GB of memory.

Beam search is employed with a beam size of 5, selected from the options of {5, 10, 15} based on validation.\n4. Pre-training is conducted for the encoder and decoder models using different data sources.\n\nBased on this information, we can calculate the total training time for the models.\n\nCalculating training time for one epoch:\n- 30 hours / 40 epochs = 0.75 hours per epoch.\n\nSince we are given the GPU model (Quadro P5000), we can assume that only one GPU is used for training.\n\nUsing the given batch size of 64, we can calculate the number of steps per epoch:\n- Number of steps per epoch = Total number of training examples / Batch size\n- Assuming the number of training examples is not provided, let's use the batch size of 64 to calculate the number of steps.\n\nNext, we need to determine the unit of the total training time. Let's assume it is in minutes.\n\nThe resulting JSON can be as follows:\n\n{ \n  \"total_time\": 0.75 * 40, \n  \"unit\": \"hours\", \n  \"gpus\": [ \n    { \"gpu\": \"Quadro P5000\", \"number_of_gpus\": 1 } \n  ] \n}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 233, "completion_tokens": 317, "total_tokens": 550}}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7k4BRKXTNnQTT9oLKzittH99h1KdF", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1691213525, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"total_time\": 1-2,\n  \"unit\": \"DAYS\",\n  \"gpus\": [\n    {\n      \"gpu\": \"NVIDIA V100\",\n      \"number_of_gpus\": 1\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 235, "completion_tokens": 52, "total_tokens": 287}}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7k4BTayQLRt6vhNhEiX8oBU7vKpr9", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1691213527, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"total_time\": 1-2, \"unit\": \"DAYS\", \"gpus\": [{\"gpu\": \"NVIDIA V100\", \"number_of_gpus\": 1}]}"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 235, "completion_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 274}}, {"id": "chatcmpl-7k4CWJX6jTgVObIST6dHZIpiPKG7Y", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1691213592, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "As per the given context, there is no specific mention of the total training time for the models.
